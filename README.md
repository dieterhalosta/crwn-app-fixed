# CRWN APP

The cwrn app was build based on a ReactJs online Udemy course. 
It's a virtual clothing shop. Very basic (on the outside) but complexe under the hood.

It's build using JS6, Create React App, Firebase for the DataBase and Stripe for the payment simulation.

Now since this was build during an online course, it's solid, no errors and as always it can be improved and further expended.
Most of the things that I've learned during this course, helped me to build further apps that I will be releasing soon.
